# What is OpenCES?

OpenCES is an open source enrollment system. This isn't just for schools
This can be used for every and any project from Car mechanic appointment
bookings, All the way to dentist appointments. It can handle anything
from simple tasks like scheduling, too more advanced tasks such as
gathering all required information from a student to give student
classes to enroll in. We hope to have this feature more advanced
so the user can just input all required information and then it
can automatically pick what they need. This will hopefully apply to all
things not just student enrollment.

# Why are we doing this?

We are doing this because enrollment software tends to be terrible and also looks even worse. 
We are doing this because we feel Schools, and anything else should have a viable alternative.
This allows us to maximize use for users perhaps speeding up the enrollment process 
and for the staff to have less to worry about and are able to focus on what matters. 

# How do I get involved? 

Getting involved is very simple if you have a love for open source software. The passion to create new and 
useful software then just simply browse our external documentation (this will allow us to go into depth 
about the product). You can help if your a designer, thinker, or of course programmer!
