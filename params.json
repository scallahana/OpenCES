This isn't just for schools\r\nThis can be used for every and any project from Car mechanic appointment\r\nbookings, All the way to dentist appointments. It can handle anything\r\nfrom simple tasks like scheduling, too more advanced tasks such as\r\ngathering all required information from a student to give student\r\nclasses to enroll in. We hope to have this feature more advanced\r\nso the user can just input all required information and then it\r\ncan automatically pick what they need. This will hopefully apply to all\r\nthings not just student enrollment.\r\n\r\n# Why are we doing this?\r\n\r\nWe are doing this because enrollment software tends to be terrible and also looks even worse. \r\nWe are doing this because we feel Schools, and anything else should have a viable alternative.\r\nThis allows us to maximize use for users perhaps speeding up the enrollment process \r\nand for the staff to have less to worry about and are able to focus on what matters. \r\n\r\n# How do I get involved? \r\n\r\nGetting involved is very simple if you have a love for open source software. The passion to create new and \r\nuseful software then just simply browse our external documentation (this will allow us to go into depth \r\nabout the product). You can help if your a designer, thinker, or of course programmer!\r\n\r\n",
